title: Legal Risks
---

This document summarizes a detailed conversation about the legal risks and design strategies for creating a fantasy basketball application or simulation that uses real NBA player names, stats, and team data. The discussion is U.S.-focused but generally applies to similar legal systems.

### Key Legal Takeaways

- **Using Real NBA Player Names and Stats:**
  - Legal when used as factual data for fantasy sports, analytics, or informational tools.
  - Protected by the First Amendment as the use of facts (names, stats, performance data).
  - Applies to both free and paid fantasy apps.

- **Using Player Likeness, Images, or Team Logos:**
  - Not legal without explicit licenses (right of publicity and trademark law).
  - Depicting players as controllable avatars, using likenesses, or simulating games visually crosses into high legal risk.
  - No public or blanket license exists for fan games; permission must be negotiated case-by-case.
  - Head shots of players that are part of statistical API can be used

- **Fantasy Sports vs. Video Games:**
  - Fantasy sports apps are protected because they use data for analysis, not expressive depiction.
  - Video games that visually simulate or let users control real players require licenses.

- **Simulated Games in Fantasy Context:**
  - Stat-based simulations (e.g., calculating scores, box scores, win probabilities) are legal if presented as data, not as visual or narrative reenactments.
  - Risk increases with any visual or narrative depiction of players performing actions.

- **Best Practices for Legal Safety:**
  - Use real names and stats only as data.
  - Present results as tables, charts, or analytical summaries.
  - Avoid player images, likenesses, or team branding.
  - Frame simulations as “models” or “projections,” not as “games” or “broadcasts.”
  - Include disclaimers clarifying the analytical and hypothetical nature of the simulation.

## Conclusion

You can build a deep, strategy-driven fantasy basketball simulation using real player names and stats, as long as you:
- Treat all data analytically
- Avoid visual or narrative depictions of real players
- Frame the experience as a model, not a game

This approach is legally defensible and mirrors how advanced fantasy and analytics platforms operate.
