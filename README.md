A monorepo exploring basketball game concepts, combining simulation design with interactive documentation.

## Projects

### Odyssey

A single-player basketball RPG/career simulation. Inspired by NBA 2K's MyPlayer mode, Pokémon, Elder Scrolls-style RPGs, and roguelites — the player controls one athlete whose career evolves through training, skill progression, mentorship, and world exploration.

### Fantasy

A fantasy basketball simulation and "what-if" analytics platform using real NBA player names and stats. Users draft teams, assign strategies, and simulate statistically realistic game outcomes presented as data and analytics rather than visual gameplay.
